Arduino Fall Detection
======================
Fall Detection project using:
- Arduino Mini Pro
- MMA7361 Accelerometer
- RF Transmitter-Receiver Module

Trying to take it to reality as fast as possible!
If you want to try this project  you should download the files in "library" and copy them in a folder (ie. MMA7361) inside "libraries" in Arduino's path folder.
