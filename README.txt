Arduino Fall Detection
======================
Fall Detection project using:
- Arduino Mini Pro
- MMA7361 Accelerometer
- RF Transmitter-Receiver Module (MX-FS-03V and MX-05V)

Trying to take it to reality as fast as possible!
If you want to try this project you just have to download the libraries and put them into "libraries" folder in Arduino's path.

Just some final tests and updates to launch the final version!
